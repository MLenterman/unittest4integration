# Goals
- Quickly develop robust unit-sized testcases to verify behavior as close to the source as possible.
- Create integration tests without having to enable stubbing.
- Not having to start the whole framework so that we can get quicker feedback on our changes and reduce time between iterations.
- In-depth debugging tools/insight available when executing testcases. e.g. breakpoints or similar.
- Leverage assertions with more flexibility and with more precision opposed to just comparing an expected result with the test result.
- User-friendly way to develop testcases by using well-known, refined and externally maintained standard testing/assertion libraries.
- (Nice to have) Freedom to choose your own favorite testing/assertion library.
